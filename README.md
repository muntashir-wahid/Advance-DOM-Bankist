# Bankist

[Bankist](https://muntashir-wahid.github.io/Advance-DOM-Bankist/) is a course project created while I was taking a course on JavaScript. It's a marketing website for a fictional bank.

## Features of the webpage

- On the webpage, you can see a fade-in effect when it comes into the viewport.
- You can see lazy loading on images when you scroll to them.
- The menu bar of the page is sticky. When you hover over each of the links, all the other links get grayed out.
- Clicking on the Open Account button, you can see a modal with a sign-up form. It will open with a nice animation.
- You can see a custom carousel component with some testimonials.

### All these effects is build with vanilla JavaScript.
